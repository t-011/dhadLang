# DhadLang

### Overview
DhadLang is a very simple arabic Procedural-like programming language. It helped me understand compilers on a deeper level, from tokenization
and parsing, up to the generation of assembly.

### Usage
#### Pre-reqs
DhadLang's compiler runs on an x64 processor on a linux system.

#### How to run your own dhadLang file

Your file should be in: dhadLang/

Then run (in dhadLang): ./dhad "your-file-name"; ./out; echo $?
To see the exit code the code exited with.
