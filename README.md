# DhadLang

A minimal Arabic-inspired programming language compiler built in C++. Compiles to x64 assembly.

## What is DhadLang?

DhadLang is a procedural language designed as a learning project for compiler development. It covers tokenization, parsing, and x64 assembly generation.

## Requirements

- Linux (x64)
- Make
- GCC/G++ (for compilation)

## Quick Start

1. Place your `.dhad` file in the project root
2. Compile and run:
```bash
   ./dhad your-file-name
   ./out
   echo $?  # View exit code
```

## Build
```bash
make
```

This project is a learning exercise in compiler design.
